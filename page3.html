                    <p>I went to University of Wisconsin for my undergraduate studies, and received a bachelor of science in philosophy. After I finished my undergraduate degree, I set off to wander the world for a couple years to figure out what I wanted to do. I just couldnâ€™t rest on a point and make a decision even though, all along, the answer was in front of me. As I was wondering in a bookstore in Montreal, I came across a book: <i>The Power of Now</i>. I saw the title; I paused for a few minutes; I atared at my surroundings. And, all of a sudden, something clicked in me. As if I found the right pieces of puzzle. I bought the book and framed it on my wall to remember the moment forever. </p>

                    <p>I went back to get my PhD in Astrophysics at Harvard University. The day after graduation, I received a call from NASA, and I accepted their offer to become the director of the Rocket Department. Now, here I am sharing my experience with you. I just thought as part of my philanthropy I must share my journey and experiences with everyone. It happened to my overnight, it can happen to you too. You just need to stop planning ahead of the time and live in the present. </p>
