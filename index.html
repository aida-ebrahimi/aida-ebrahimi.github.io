            We have been trained to be conscience of our surroundings. Our parents raised us to be afraid of the unknown. Our society warns us about not following the known path. And because of that, we don't take risks, we are not spontaneous, and we are always bored and anxious. The paranoia that our society perpetuates, makes us uncomfortable to be surrounded by people; makes us uncomfortable to experience things that we would never imagine; makes us uncomfortable to accept who we are.

            My name is Aida. I am an astrophysicist working for NASA. My job is to ensure everything goes smoothly in the Rocket Department. You may say I am the peace keeper in the department! People in my department are happy, focused, and on track. There has been psychological research at NASA that compared rate of happiness amongst different departments, and, of course, the Rocket Department has won the <i>Most Happiest and Cheeriest Department Award</i> for 15 years now.
