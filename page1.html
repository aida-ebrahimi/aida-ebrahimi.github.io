                    <p>My friends generally describe me as a decisive, confident, adventures, risk taker, and witty person. Seems like I can't be boiled down to just one word, but again that’s better than no words! I never plan my future, not even 2 minutes from now! I am completely serious. It is possible because I am doing it. Living in the present moment does not require any planning of the future. I fully submerge myself to the present moment and take advantage of the power of now. Because of it, I am happy. I am happier than I ever was. I don’t have anxiety, and I’m never depressed. It’s so easy that you can do it too.</p>

                    <p>After I finished my undergraduate, I woke up one day and headed up north. I kept driving and driving until it was night time. With no destination in mind, with no concrete plans, I ended up spending 9 days in the woods. It was the most liberating time of my life. I befriended an owl and three raccoons. All I had with me was a tent and a blanket. I found a little wagon and carried everything in that wagon, including my new friends, of course!</p>
